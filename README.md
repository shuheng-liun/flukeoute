#Welcome to CSS Diner
This is a quick game to learn and refresh your knowledge of CSS selectors.

To play, visit [flukeout.github.io](http://flukeout.github.io/)

###Filing issues and PRs
Please file issues and PRs in the [css-diner repo](https://github.com/flukeout/css-diner/).

###Repo structure
Here's the repo structure, it's a bit confusing...

* Currently, all of the working code (including issues, PRs and in-progress branches) is hosted in the [css-diner repo](https://github.com/flukeout/css-diner/)
  * The lastest version of the code is on the ``develop`` branch
* The live version is published from the [flukeout.github.io repo](https://github.com/flukeout/flukeout.github.io/issues)
  * Live version lives on the ``master`` branch

###Deploying

This is more of a note to myself in case I forget, to deploy the latest version, I'll have to push to the ``master`` branch on the ``flukeout.github.io`` repo from the latest ``develop`` branch.
